# FSJS_Project-7_React-Gallery-App

The seventh of ten projects for the Full stack Javascript Techdegree program at TreeHouse.

## Project Overview

For this project, I've used the very popular and in-demand React library to create an image gallery app. With the help of this powerful "MVC" (Model, View, Controller) library, the app has been built in the style of modern single-page applications to keep it fast, modular, and in sync with current web development trends.

I have learned about some of the best practices of working with [React], like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in your JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. Additionally, I have practiced working with React-supportive tools like the Create React App and React Router modules.

Using the powerful Create React App tool, I did set up the initial project.

Then I did:

- Use JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
- Use React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
- Use the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and use it to display images in your app.
- Add logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
- Add to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
